# Iguider: A Web Application for Automated STIX Reports Generation from Cyber Threat Intelligence

## Project Description
Iguider is a web application designed to automate the generation of **STIX (Structured Threat Information Expression)** reports from **cyber threat intelligence** using **large language models**. The goal of this project is to leverage advanced technologies to automate and streamline the process of generating detailed threat intelligence reports. Throughout this internship, I worked on various components such as **graph databases**, **malware analysis reports**, and **large language models**, while also gaining hands-on experience with **CI/CD pipelines** for production-level application development.


## Duties/Activities
As part of this internship, I was involved in:
- **Designing a Web UI** for a command-line tool that extracts and generates STIX reports from cyber threat intelligence data.
- **Building the Web UI** using **React** (or another frontend framework) to create a user-friendly interface for interacting with the core tool.
- **Developing a Query Engine** using **Neo4j** graph database to manage and process the threat data efficiently.
- **Creating a Backend API** to facilitate communication between the frontend and the core tool, ensuring smooth data extraction, processing, and report generation.

## Required Skills
- **Frontend Frameworks**: Familiarity with **React**, **Vue**, **Flutter**, or other similar frameworks for developing modern web applications.
- **Web Application Development**: A good understanding of web application workflows and client-server interactions.
- **System Design Knowledge**: Some experience with designing scalable and efficient systems.
- **Concurrency & Web Sockets**: Understanding blocking/non-blocking behaviors, and web socket integration for real-time communication.

## Preferred Intern Academic Level: Senior
This project is ideal for senior students with a strong background in software engineering and an interest in building real-world applications with a focus on system design, web development, and CI/CD pipelines.

## Learning Opportunities
During this internship, I had the opportunity to:
- **System Design**: Work on the architecture of a production-level web application that processes large amounts of data and performs heavy tasks such as data extraction and report generation.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Gain hands-on experience in setting up and working with **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** pipelines to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying the application.
- **Git for Production**: Learn to manage code using **Git** in a production environment, collaborating with teams, and adhering to best practices in version control.

## Technologies Used:
- **Frontend**: React (or another suitable frontend framework)
- **Backend**: Flask (or another backend framework)
- **Database**: Neo4j (Graph Database)
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or other relevant tools
